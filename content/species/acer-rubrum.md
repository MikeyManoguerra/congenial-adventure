 Acer rubrum, the red maple, also known as swamp, water or soft maple,
  is one of the most common and widespread deciduous trees of eastern and
  central North America. The U.S. Forest service recognizes it as the most
  abundant native tree in eastern North America.[4] The red maple ranges from
  southeastern Manitoba around the Lake of the Woods on the border with Ontario
  and Minnesota, east to Newfoundland, south to Florida, and southwest to East
  Texas. Many of its features, especially its leaves, are quite variable in
  form. At maturity, it often attains a height of around 30 m (100 ft). Its
  flowers, petioles, twigs and seeds are all red to varying degrees. Among these
  features, however, it is best known for its brilliant deep scarlet foliage in
  autumn. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_rubrum)
