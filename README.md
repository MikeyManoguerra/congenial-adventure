# Congenial adventure

## Description: 

Mini tours of Public Art and Nature in Philadelphia and beyond. Each tour is centered around a piece of public Art, A mural, statue, etc . The tour then identifies individual near by trees, providing info about the morphology.

Each tour provides a map identifying the art and the nearby trees. An expected future feature is the ability to locate other nearby tours.

If the project grows, ideally tour creation could expand to include the public  in some way
